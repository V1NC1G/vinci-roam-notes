* The Open Systems Interconnection Model

Developed in the '70h by the *Organization for Standardization (ISO)*, it provided a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other.

* Layers of the OSI Model

The OSI model splits up a communication system into 7 abstract layers, stacked upon each other:
1. Application Layer
   - Contains the applications or protocols that are almost always implemented in software.
   - 
2. Presentation Layer
3. Session Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Network Layer
6. Data Link Layer
7. Physical Layer

The main purpose of this network stack is to understand how the components of these protocols fit into the stack and work with each other.
