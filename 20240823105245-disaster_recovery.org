Disaster recovery is about what to plan for and do when disaster occurs which knocks out a system. It comes in two stages:
- Pre-planning
- DR Process

It is used when HA and FT does not work.

Example of pre-planning:
- Doing regular data backups and storing them somewhere else

Example of DR process:
- Having a backup system away from the main system ready to replace the main system when disaster occurs.
