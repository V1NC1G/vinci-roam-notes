High availability (HA) is not aiming to stop failure. A highly available system is one designed to be online and providing services as often as possible.

Components in a HA system should be easily replaced when it fails, as quickly as possible. Often using automation.

Basically, HA is about maximizing a system's online time.

User disruption, while not ideal is okay. HA is only aboud minimizing any outages.
