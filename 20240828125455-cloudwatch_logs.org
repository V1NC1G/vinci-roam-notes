* CloudWatch Logs
A public service, usable from AWS or on-premises, or other cloud platforms. (regional)

Allow storing, accessing, and monitoring logging data.

Has built-in integration with other AWS services including:
- EC2
- VPC Flow Logs
- Lambda
- CloudTrail
- R53
- etc.

CloudWatch can also generate metrics based on logs - *metric filter*

The sources that CloudnWatch gets logging data from emit *log events* which looks like ~YYYYMMDDHHMMSS MESSAGE~. Basically a ~timestamp~ and a ~message block~.

These log events are stored into *log streams* which are log events from the same source.

Within CloudWatch Logs are *log groups* which are *containers* for multiple log streams for same type of logging. It also stores *configuration settings* and *metric filters are defined.
