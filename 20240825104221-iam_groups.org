* IAM Groups
Container for users. Basically organizing IAM users.

A user cannot login to IAM groups.

Benefits:
1. Allow administrator-style management of users
2. Groups can have policies attached to them which is both ~inline~ and ~managed~ policies
   - Users inside the group can also have attached policies with them
   - The policies are merged and evaluated by AWS as one

Nesting is not applicable. Basically we cannot have groups within groups.

There is a limit of ~300 groups~ per account, but it can be increased with a support ticket.

Groups are not a *true identity*. It cannot be referenced as a principal in a policy. Basically resource policy cannot grant access to IAM groups.
