#+title: Fault Tolerance

Fault tolerance means that if a system has faults, it *should continue to operate properly* even if those faults are present and being fixed.

Comparing with HA, HA is about maximizing uptime, FA is about operating through failure.

Implementing FA is much more expensive than HA because a system needs redundancies and needs to be designed in such a way that it will operate through failure.
