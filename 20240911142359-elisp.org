* List Processing

Lists are bouned by paretheses, and sometimes preceded by an apostrophe. It looks like: ~'(rose violet daisy buttercup)~.

Lisp "atoms" are words/values that cannot be divided into any smaller parts.

A printed representation of woth atoms and lists are called *symbolic expressions* or ~s-expressions~.

Types of /atoms/:
- Symbols: ~(foo bar foo-bar)~
- Numbers: ~(1 2 3)~
- String: ~("hello world")~

When a list have a "quote" (~'(+ 2 2)~) that precedes the list, it tells Lisp to *do nothing* with the list, other than take it as it is written. If there is no quote preceding the list then the *first* item of the list becomes a *command* (function) for the machine to obey.
