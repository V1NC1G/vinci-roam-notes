* Service-linked roles
IAM role linked to a specific AWS service.

It provides a set of permissions that are *predefined* by a service so it can interact with other AWS services on your behalf.

It might be *created by the service*, or allow the user to create the role during the setup of the service, or created within IAM.

The difference with IAM Roles is that service-linked roles cannot be deleted until it is no longer required.

~PassRole~ is basically allowing to pass an existing role to an AWS service, and an example of *role separation*. It means that the user can configure the service with a role that has already been created.
