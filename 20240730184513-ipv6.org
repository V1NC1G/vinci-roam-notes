* Why IPv6?

IPv4 was initially designed for a research network that would connect some research labs and universities. For this purpose, 32 bit addresses which is approx. 4.3 billion addresses seemed sufficient. 32 bits was also a convenient size for software-based routers.

With the popularity of the Internet, we are running out of addresses so *IPv6 was created to tackle the limitations of IPv4*.

* IPv6 Features

** Pros

- *Simplified Header*
  - All IPv4 options are moved to the end of the IPv6 header.
  - IPv6 header is twice as large as IPv4 headers but only because they are four times longer.
- *Larger Address Space*
  - 4 times as many bits as IPv4.
  - 128 bits wide, approx *340 undecillion addresses*
  
** Cons

- A complete redesign over IPv4 so *it is not backwards compatible*. This means that devices configured over IPv4 cannot acces websites on servers configured with IPv6.
- Upgrading to IPv6 hardware is expensive for ISPs and not directly translatable in terms of profit.

* Textual Representation of IPv6

Format: ~x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x~, where the ~x~ represents the eight 16-bit parts of the address in *hexadecimal digits*.

Examples:
- ~ABCD:EF01:2345:6789:ABCD:EF01:2345:6789~
- ~2001:DB8:0:0:8:800:200C:417A~

In the case bits are set to ~0~, compact notation is used by using ~::~. For example:
- ~FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:101~ is represented as ~FF01::101~
- ~0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1~ is represented as ~::1~
- ~0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0~ is represented as ~::~

An IPv6 prefix can also be represented as ~address/length~ where the ~length~ is the length of the prefix in bits. For example:
- ~2001:0DB8:0000:CD30:0000:0000:0000:0000/60~
- ~2001:0DB8::CD30:0:0:0:0/60~
- ~2001:0DB8:0:CD30::/60~

* Address Format & Types

From the experience with IPv4, it has been revealed that *scalability* of a network layer protocol *heavily depends on its addressing architecture.* The designers of IPv6 therefor spent a lot of effort defining its addressing architecture.

IPv6 supports *unicast*, *multicast*, and *anycast* addresses.

** Unicast

As with IPv4, IPv6 unicast address is used to identify one data link layer interface on a host. If a host has several data link layer interfaces (such as Ethernet and WiFi interfaces), then it needs several IPv6 addresses.

An IPv6 unicast consists of three parts:
1. *Global Routing Prefix*: Assigned to the ISP that owns this block of address.
2. *Subnet Identifier*: Identifies a customer of the ISP.
3. *Interface Identifier*: Identifies a particular interface on an end-system.
   - Usually 64-bits based on the MAC (data link layer address)

In general, IPv6 is structured as ~{Global Routing Prefix}:{Subnet ID}:{Interface ID}~.

[[file:./images/ipv6-unicast-structure.png]]

In today's deployment, interface identifiers are always *64 bits*, so addresses must be grouped in $2^{64}$ subnets. Using 64 bits for the host identifier allows the addresses to be auto-configured and provides security benefits.

In practice, there are *several types of IPv6 multicast address*.

*** Provider Independent Address

Most of the IPv6 unicast addresses are allocated in blocks under the responsibility of *IANA*. The current IPv6 allocations are part of the *2000::/3* address block. Regional Internet Registries have each received a block of IPv6 addresses that they sub-allocate to ISPs in their region. The ISPs then sub-allocate addresses to their customers as usual.

The RIRs allocate *provider-independent (PI) addresses*.

- PI addresses are usually allocated to ISPs and large companies that are connected to at least two different ISPs.
- Once allocated to a company, this company can use its address block with the provider of choice and change its provider at will.
- ISPs allocate provider-aggregatable (PA) address blocks from their own PI address block to their customers.
- A company that is connected to only one ISP should only use PA addresses.

*** Disadvantages of PI Addresses

When a company using a PA address block changes its provider, it needs to change all the addresses that it uses. This can be a nightmare from an operational perspective, and many companies are lobbying to obtain PI address blocks even if they are small and connected to a single provider.

*** Unique Local Unicast Addresses

Unique Local Unicast (ULA) addresses (FC00::/7) are for the companies that want to use IPv6 without being connected to the IPv6 Internet. These addresses play a same role as the private IPv4 addresses defined in [[https:datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918.html][RFC1918]]. However the size of the FC00::/7 address block allows ULA to much more flexible than the private IPv4 addresses.

The IETF has reserved some IPv6 addresses for special usage. The two most important ones are:
- *::1* is the *loopback address*. This is the address of the logical interface that is always up and running on IPv6 enabled hosts. It is equivalent to *127.0.0.1* in IPv4.
- *::* is the *unspecified IPv6 address* that a host can use a local source address when trying to acquire an official address.

*** Link-Local Unicast Addresses

The last type of unicast IPv6 address which are part of the *FE80::/10* address block.
- Each host can compute its own local-link address by *concatenating* the ~FE80::/10~ prefix with the 64 bits identifier of its interface.
- Can be used when hosts are attached to the same link (or LAN) need to exchange packets.
- Used for address discovery and auto-configuration purposes.
- Usage is restricted to each link, and router cannot forward a packet whose source or destination address is a local-link address.
- Also defined for IPv4 however it is only used when a host cannot obtain a regular IPv4 address.

[[file:images/ipv6-link-local-address-structure.png]]

An important consequence of the IPv6 unicast addressing structure and the utilization of link-local addresses is that *an IPv6 host has several IPv6 addresses.* This implies that an IPv6 stack must be able to handle multiple IPv6 addresses. That is not always the case for IPv4.

** Anycast Addresses

On a subnetwork having prefix ~p/n~, the IPv6 address whose 128-n low-order bits are set to 0 is the anycast address that corresponds to all routers inside this subnetwork.

This anycast address can be used by hosts to quickly send a packet to any routers inside their own network.

** Multicast Addresses

The structure of an IPv6 multicast address is as follows:

- The lower order 112 bits are the group's identifier. The higher order bits are used as a marker to distinguish multicast addresses from unicast addresses.
- The 4 bits flag field indicates whether the address is temporary or permanent.
- The scope field indicates the boundaries of the forwarding of packets destined to a particular address.
  - *Link local scope*: router should not forward a packet destined to such a multicast address
  - *Organizational local scope*: packets send to a multicast destination should not leave the organization
  - *Global scope*: for multicast groups spanning the global Internet.

All end-system automatically belong to the *FF02::1* multicast group while all routers automatically belong to the *FF02::2* multicast group.
