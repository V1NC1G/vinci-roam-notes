* Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

Pretty much the default compute service within AWS. It provides access to VMs called "instances".

It should be the default starting point for any compute requirement in AWS.

EC2 is *IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service)*. Because it is IAAS, the unit of consumption is an instance.

*Private* AWS service by default -- runs in the private AWS zone. EC2 instances are configured to launch into a single VPC subnet.

*AZ* resilient, the instance fails if the AZ fails.

Can have various instance sizes and capabilites.

On demand billing, per second or per hour.

Option for storage:
- Local on-host storage
- Elastic Block Store (EBS)

* Instance Lifecycle
EC2 instances has an attribute called *state* which indicates the instance condition.
- Running
- Stopped
- Terminated

- After provisioning, state = ~running~
- Shutting down, state = ~running~ to ~stopped~
- Start the instance, state = ~stopped~ to ~running~
- Terminating can be done from ~running~ or ~stopped~ but it is a one way change, it is non reversible.

State matter so much because it influences the charges for the instance.

Charges Table: X = Charged by AWS

| State      | CPU | Memory | Disk | Networking |
|------------+-----+--------+------+------------|
| Running    | X   | X      | X    | X          |
| Stopped    |     |        | X    |            |
| Terminated |     |        |      |            |

* Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

AMI is an image of an EC2 instance, used to create an EC2 instance, or can be created from an EC2 instance.

Contains:
- Attached permissions
  - Control accounts that can use the AMI
  - *Public* -- everyone allowed
  - *Owner* - *Implicit* allow
  - *Explicit* - specific AWS accounts allowed
- Root Volume
  - Drive that *boots* the OS
- Block Device Mapping
  - Configuration that links the volumes the AMI has and how it is presented in the OS.
