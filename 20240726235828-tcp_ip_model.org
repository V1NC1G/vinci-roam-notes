* The TCP/IP Model

The TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)/IP (Internet Protocol) model is also called the *Internet Protocol suite*. It is primarily based upon the most protocols of the Internet.

The protocols in each layer is clearly defined, and it takes in a *protocol-oriented* approach. Because it is simpler than the OSI model, it is used for practical applications. It can also handle error detection and recovery unlike the OSI model.

* Layers of the TCP/IP Stack

The layers of the TCP/IP stack is divided into *5 abstract layers* where each layer performs a particular service and communicate with the layers above and below itself.
