* The Shell

The shell is a program that takes commands from your keyboard and sends it to the OS to perform.

The shell prompt (specifically for bash (Bourne Again Shell)) looks something like this:
#+begin_src bash
  username@hostname:current_directory

  vinci@icebox:/home/vinci $
#+end_src

The prompt for bash is ~$~, and it is different for different shells.

* echo

The ~echo~ command just prints out the text arguments to display.

#+begin_src bash
  echo Hello World
#+end_src
